This is a port of Chris Cowley's VB81 visual basic 6.0 ZX81 emulator to C# in a Microsoft Visual Studio project. 
The original project would not work in the current version of Visual Studio with a number of compatability issues.
A few bugs also got fixed e.g. sometimes having to press a key twice for it to register. 

Xavsnap's excellent VB81 XuR won't work in the current Visual Studio / under vb.net either but reviewing its code helped me fix some of the bugs in the original.

There are better emulators out there (including VB81 XuR and EightyOne) but I find being able to use the current Visual Studio much easier for tinkering and understanding how the thing works.
